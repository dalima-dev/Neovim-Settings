# Neovim-Settings
This is the NeoVim Settings I use.

Put init.vim and coc-settings.json files in /.config/nvim directory.
Font files you put in /.local/share/fonts directory.


Watch the following tutorials:

I already have the init.vim with all settings I like, therefore, just modify to your taste.
